| --- | ---------------------- | ----- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1   | Project Setup          | 0     | Set up your development environment and structure your project with appropriate tools and frameworks.                                                                |
| 2   | Database Integration   | 0     | Use a database (preferably MongoDB) to store job listings. Retrieve job data from the database and display it in the relevant sections of your site.                 |
| 3   | Navbar and Sidebar     | 0     | Use the provided boilerplate for creating a functional navbar and sidebar.                                                                                           |

| 5   | Other Jobs Section     | 2     | Display other job listings from your database. Ensure that clicking the "Apply" button for these jobs opens the corresponding LinkedIn page in a new tab.            |
| 6   | Job Search             | 4     | Implement a search functionality that allows users to search for jobs by title, company, or keywords. The search should retrieve relevant results from the database. |
| 7   | Job Filters            | 5     | Implement filters that allow users to narrow down job results (e.g., by job type, location).                                                                         |
| 8   | Deployment             | 6     | Deploy your project to a live environment, ensuring it is accessible via a public URL.                                                                               |
